	<p>Free Willy is peak ‘90s nostalgia. Who watched this movie and didn’t fall in love with the black and white behemoth? Fans were so inspired, they helped raise the millions of dollars necessary to try to release the orca/actor back into the wild (with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000002441985/freeing-willy.html">questionable success</a>). <mark><strong>Unfortunately, the reality and history of captivity is more complex than the movie suggested, and the complexity has only increased in the years since.</strong></mark></p>
 
	<p>But Free Willy wasn’t the first (or the last) movie to surface this topic to mainstream conversation. To clear up some of these complexities, let’s take a brief stroll through the history of dolphin and whale (cetacean) captivity. We will explore the past, present, and future of cetacean captivity in the US, and how it is depicted by data and pop culture.</p>

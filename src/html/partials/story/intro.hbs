	<p class='intro__prose'>Free Willy is peak ‘90s nostalgia. Who watched this movie and didn’t fall in love with the black and white behemoth? Fans were so inspired, they helped raise the $20 million necessary to try to release the orca/actor back into the wild. Unfortunately, the reality and history of captivity is more complex than in the movie, and the complexity has only increased in the years since.</p>
 
	<p class='intro__prose'>But Free Willy wasn’t the first (or the last) movie to surface these topics to the mainstream.  To disentangle some of these complexities, let’s take a brief stroll through the history of dolphin and whale (cetacean) captivity.  We will explore the past, present, and future of cetacean captivity in the US through both data and pop-culture.</p>

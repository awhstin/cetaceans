		<p>Another point of disagreement between both sides of this debate revolves around animal survival. Specifically, whether or not animals in captivity survive as long as their wild counterparts.</p>

		<p>While a Google search may yield seemingly definitive answers to this question, the full answer is a bit more complicated. Often during conversations of life span, people will discuss the maximum age these animals can live.  But this can be misleading. For instance, the longest a human US citizen has ever lived is 119 years old. But that number does not give any insight into how long you or I will likely live.</p>  

		<p>Instead, we generally rely on life expectancy estimates. In the US, the average human can expect to live around 79 years. This number is calculated based on <mark>how likely it is that you will survive another year</mark>. Wildlife researchers use this same "annual survival rate" for studying wild animal populations.</p>

		<p>So, let's look at how the annual survival rate (ASR) has changed over time for the 4 most common captive cetacean species. </p>

		<p><mark><strong>Methodology Note</strong></mark>: The entire course of cetacean captivity has been equally split into 3 time categories: 1939 - 1964, 1965 - 1991, and 1992 - 2016. ASR was calculated for the entire population of animals that entered captivity during each time category as described in DeMaster and Drevenak (1988). Due to small sample sizes and to compare to wild animal ASR, age-specific survival rates were not calculated (that is, a 2-year-old animal has the same calculated probability of surviving another year as a 40-year-old animal).  Also for comparitive purposes with wild animal studies, animals that died at younger than 1 year of age were excluded from analysis. Values for wild animal ASR were accessed from scientific literature. Full references available in the reference section.</p>

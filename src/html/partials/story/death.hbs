		<p>You may have noticed that if a breeding ban went into effect this year and all animals died young, we'd still have captive cetaceans until the early 2030's. The point is, these animals aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. </p>

		<p>So what do we do? One alternative plan that has been discussed a lot recently is to keep animals in “seaside sanctuaries” or “sea pens”. These are essentially nets that enclose a natural lagoon in the ocean. The animals would still need to be fed, trained, and cared for by veterinarians, but they would be in the ocean water.</p> 
 
		<p>Those in favor of sea pens claim that experiencing the ocean would act as a sort of “retirement” to animals kept in captivity for long periods of time. Those against sea pens cite that the ocean is home to diseases, pollution, and underwater “noise pollution” that could threaten the captive-born animals. Alternatively, some worry that putting these animals back into the ocean could introduce new problems for wild populations (think antibiotic resistant strains of diseases). </p>
 
		<p>It’s hard to know who is right here and what is best for both the captive and wild animals. But, we do have some data to work with. Some facilities within the US have always housed their animals in sea pens. Are there higher rates of disease-related deaths in sea pen housed animals?</p>

		<p>Rates of pneumonia and septicemia are higher in sea penned animals than those in tanks, and, perhaps surprisingly, drowning is also more common in sea pens. Keep in mind, over 50,000 people in the US died of pneumonia in 2016, and like in the case of humans, pneumonia is frequently the immediate cause of death, but not the long-term cause (i.e. if someone had cancer and ultimately died of pneumonia). We don’t have full health records for these animals, but it seems plausible that animals in sea pens were more susceptible to death by pneumonia or exhaustion (which could lead to drowning).</p>

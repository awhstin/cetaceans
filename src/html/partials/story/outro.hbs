	<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> All data came from the <a href='https://foiaonline.regulations.gov/foia/action/public/view/request?objectId=090004d28075988d'>National Marine Mammal Inventory</a> (as curated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and the crowd-sourced website <a href='http://www.cetabase.org/'>Ceta Base</a>. Any duplicate entries (i.e., animals that showed up in both data sets) were removed. Data was limited to animals that currently reside (or resided at time of death) in the United States. </p>

	<p><strong>Thank Yous:</strong> This story went through some pretty heavy revisions thanks to the insight from several people that have this debate close to their hearts. So, many thanks to Andy Stamper, Wendi Fellner, and Heidi Harley for extensive feedback and to Douglas DeMaster for assistance and clarification of annual survival rate calculations.</p>

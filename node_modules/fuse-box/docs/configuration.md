# Configuration

The concept of FuseBox is simple. Bundle anything for frontend and server without a headache. Simply put, you can copy paste a simple config down below and bundle some heavy module like `babel-core` or `babel-generator`. But let's get started and break down all available options in fusebox.

## Initialisation

Initialise a fuse-box instance like so. 
```js
FuseBox.init({ /* you config is here */ })
```

## Home directory

That's your _source_ folder. FuseBox locks your project to it. FuseBox will resolve it relatively your `fuse.js` file location

```js
FuseBox.init({
  homeDir: "src/",
})
```

files:
node_modules
 placeholder.js
stuff
 src
  index.ts
 fuse.js



In the example above your `homeDir` will be pointing to `stuff/src` next to `fuse.js` file.

note: it's not recommended using absolute paths. It reduces readability


## Output

Output is a string which is used by FuseBox to determine where and how to place your bundles in the file system.

```js
FuseBox.init({
  homeDir: "src",
  output: "build/$name.js",
})
```

There are few macros available.

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| $name  | The name of your bundle  |
| $hash  | Applying hash when available  |

`$hash` is used when the hash option is set, otherwise it will be removed. FuseBox will create folders automatically, so you don't need to worry if a folder is present. FuseBox will also tolerate an absense of `$name` macro, converting it internally into a template

For example this:

```js
 output: "build/out.js"
```

Will be converted accordingly to:

```js
 output: "build/$name.js"
```

However it is strongly recommended to use `$name` in your output template, as `out.js` will be ignored

## Cache

You can turn off caching if you like. By default caching is on. FuseBox will create a folder `.fusebox` in your project path, and store related files. Don't forget to add it to .gitignore.

note: If things go wrong or things are not updating, delete the `.fusebox` folder to force clear the cache.

```js
const fuse = FuseBox.init({
  homeDir: "src",
  output: "build/$name.js",
  cache: true
})
```

Alternatively, you can disable cache by using chainable API

```js
fuse.bundle("app")
    .cache(false)
    .instructions("> index.ts")
```

## Debug and Log
Additional logging and debugging can be enabled, but keep in mind they can reduce performance.
```js
const fuse = FuseBox.init({
  homeDir: "src",
  output: "build/$name.js",
  log: true,
  debug: true
})
```


## Custom modules folder

You probably would want to test a package some day, or just have an abstraction on top of your code. For that, you can use `modulesFolder` property. It behaves exactly the same like another npm module, just in a custom folder.

```js
FuseBox.init({
    modulesFolder: "modules",
})
```


You local `npm` will have the highest priority. In essence, you can override fusebox's [path](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/modules/path/index.js) of [fs](https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box/blob/master/modules/fs/index.js) module if you like. Customize you packages in your own manner!

files:
modules
 foo
  index.js
src
 index.ts

You don't need to create `package.json` - `index.js` will work just fine. It will be [cached](#cache) like any other npm module with version `0.0.0`, so remember to toggle cache property in the config


## tsConfig

A path to typescript configuration `tsconfig` can be overridden like so:

```js
FuseBox.init({
    tsConfig : "src/myconfig.json"
})
```

Or using the chain API

```js
fuse
    .bundle("app")
    .tsConfig("src/myconfig.json")
```

## Package name
You default package name is `default`, You don't need to change it if you are not planning on having isolated bundles.
Any bundle added as a script tag will share `default` package, keep that in mind. If you want to release a package (say to npm), you probably would want set a different name (to avoid scope collision)

It's imperative having a __unique name__ (matching an npm package) when publishing a bundle to NPM.


```js
FuseBox.init({
    package: "mySuperLib",
})
```
If you want to have an entry point (main) file, define it like so:

```js
FuseBox.init({
    package:{
        name: "mySuperLib",
        main: "index.ts",
    },
})
```
note: If you don't want to have your package execute on load, make sure your instruction does not have `>` in it.

Here is an example how make a package:
```js
const fuse = FuseBox.init({
    homeDir: `src-package`,
    outFile: `build/$name.js`,
    package: {
        name: "super-name",
        entry: "index.ts",
    },
});
fuse.bundle("app").instructions("index.ts")
```


## Global variables

You can expose your package variables to `window` (in browser) and `exports`in node respectively.

```js
FuseBox.init({
    // exposes window.mySuperLib
    globals: { default: "mySuperLib" },
})
```

Whereas key is the name of a package and value is an alias that groups exports. "default" is your current project.

You can also expose your packages exports to `window` or `exports`.

```js
// assuming mySuperLib exports a "handler" and "logger" property

FuseBox.init({
    // exposes window.superHandler
    globals: { "mySuperLib": { "handler": "superHandler"} },

    // OR
    // exposes window.handler and window.logger
    globals: { "mySuperLib": "*" },
})

```

You can use the chainable API if you like:

```js
fuse.bundle("app").globals(/* configuration */)
```

note: In order to expose your package, a bundle must have a [package name](#package-name)

## Hash
Hashing is enabled by adding `hash` property

Make sure you checked the [output](#output) section

```js
FuseBox.init({
    hash : true
})
```


## Sourcemaps

Sourcemaps in FuseBox are enabled by setting the sourceMaps property in a FuseBox configuration object:

```js
sourceMaps: true
```

You can also provide an object to allow vendor sourcemaps:

```js
sourceMaps: { project: true, vendor: true }
```

Alternatively via chainable API

```js
fuse.bundle("app").sourceMaps(true)
```


warning: vendor sourcemaps will be generated correctly with disabled cache. It's a known bug

Sourcemaps currently work with typescript, BabelPlugin and SourceMapPlainJsPlugin

## Standalone

By default FuseBox injects API in every bundle. That can be overridden by setting:

```
{ standalone : false }
```

Alternatively, you add `!` symbol to the arithmetics, for example

```js
fuse.bundle("app").instructions("!>index.ts")
```


Load the API from the CDN:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/fuse-box/dist/fusebox.min.js"></script>
```

## Plugins

`plugins` option expects an array of plugins

```js
FuseBox.init({
    plugins:[
        TypeScriptHelpers(),
        JSONPlugin(),
        [LESSPlugin(), CSSPlugin()],
    ],
})
```

Chaining is achieved by wrapping a list using array

```js
[LESSPlugin(), CSSPlugin()]
```

You can provided a RegEx or a simplified RegEx as a first element to override the initial match of a group:

```js
["less/*.less",LESSPlugin(), CSSPlugin()]
```


FuseBox tests each file running it through the plugin list. If it sees an array, it test for the first Plugin on the list test (which is `.scss` in our case. 

```js
[".scss", SassPlugin(), CSSPlugin()] // simple and clean
[/\.scss$/, SassPlugin(), CSSPlugin()] // more verbose
```

## Target

At this moment target exists only to switch to [electron](https://electron.atom.io/) mode

```js
fuse.bundle("app").target("electron")
```

### Example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuse-box/fuse-box-electron-seed.git
npm install
npm start
```

It's planned to introduce `browser` and `server` target that would affect the build. At this very moment, your builds are universal, that means that you can execute them on browser and on server accordingly.

## Simplified RegExp

FuseBox understands wildcards which are converted to RegExp

For example:

```js
plugins : [
    ["styles/*.css", CSSPlugin({group: "bundle.css"})] // will group files under "styles" folder
    ["components/*.css", CSSPlugin()] // will inline all styles that match components path
]
```

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `.css`  | Matches all files ending with .css  |
| `components/*.css`  | Matches all css files in components folder  |
| `components/**.css`  | Matches all css files in components and under  |





## Auto import

If you are into black magic, this API is for you.

```js
FuseBox.init({
    autoImport: {
        Inferno: "inferno",
    },
})
```
Whereas the key `Inferno` (uppercase) is a variable name, and `inferno` (lowercase) is a require statement.

Your code is being analysed for variable declarations. If you use the `Inferno` variale in your code in any way but declaring it,
FuseBox will inject the require statement `var Inferno = require("inferno")`

Example:
```js
Inferno.doMagic()
```

Will result in:

```js
var Inferno = require("inferno");
Inferno.doMagic()
```

However `var Inferno = {};` will do nothing.

## Natives
FuseBox automatically imports this packages `stream`, `process`, `Buffer`, `http`

Some cases, however, require omitting:

```js
FuseBox.init({
   natives : {
      process : false
   }
})
```

Use `stream`, `process`, `Buffer`, `http` keys to override default settings.

## Alias
If you are coming from WebPack this feature might be helpful.

```js
FuseBox.init({
    alias: {
        "faraway": "~/somewhere/far/away/",
    },
})
```

* The tilde is required to resolve your `homeDir`
* Aliases will not work with absolute paths (it goes against the concept of FuseBox)



You can also alias npm packages:

```js
FuseBox.init({
    alias: {
        "babel-utils": "babel/dist/something/here/utils",
    },
})
```

Alternatively you can use the chainable API

```js
fuse.bundle("app")
    .alias("foo", "~/foo/f")
    .alias("bar", "~/bar/b")
```


In your code, you would use it in a way similar to this:
```js
import utils from "babel-utils"
import faraway from "faraway"

console.log(utils, faraway);
```

Behind the scenes, (assuming the previous code block is `homeDir/src/index.js`) this code is actually transformed into:
```js
import utils from "../node_modules/babel/dist/something/here/utils"
import faraway from "../somewhere/far/away/"

console.log(utils, faraway);
```

## Shimming

For those libraries that are bundled to work in `window` (jquery) for example, you need to provide a shimming configuration.
FuseBox will not do analysis on that file, it will simply add it to the top of the bundle.

```js
FuseBox.init({
   shim: {
        jquery: {
            source: "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js",
            exports: "$",
        },
   }
});
```

You can remove `source` option if you load a library using the script tag (for example from a CDN). After it has been shimmed,
you can use FuseBox API, or import/require statement to obtain it.

```js
import * as foo from "jquery"
console.log(foo);
```

The key `jquery` in our case is used to define package name: for example, you can replace `jquery` with `foo` and use `import "foo"` to get a jquery instance.

Example shim config:
```js
shim: {
   "react-native-web": { exports: "require('react-native')"},
}
```
Now you can reference it like  `window.ReactNative`, and require function is at your convenience.

note: shims will not be analyzed, which means they should be transpiled before importing, or imported into an environment that does not need them to be transpiled. Shimming works similar to [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) and [jspm](http://jspm.io/).

For an example, see [shimming in the fuse config](https://github.com/fuse-box/shimming-and-css-example/blob/master/fuse.js#L7) and [how it can be accessed in your code](https://github.com/fuse-box/shimming-and-css-example/blob/master/src/index.ts#L4)

note:  shimming does not work on the server. so if you use shared configuration for both your server and client bundle, remove the shimming option from the global one, and add shim() to your client bundle configuration only. For example:

```.js
const fuse = FuseBox.init({
    homeDir: "src",
    output: "dist/$name.js",
});
fuse.bundle("client/app")
    .shim({
        jquery: {
            source: "node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js",
            exports: "$"
        }
    })
    .instructions(`>app.tsx`);
 ```
